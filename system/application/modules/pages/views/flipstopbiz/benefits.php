                <p>
                    Traditional media, such as Filipino newspapers, are generally NOT read by
                    the young generations of Filipinos in the U.S and abroad. Which means ads
                    in traditional media are RARELY seen by young Filipinos consumers.
                    Flipstop&#153; users, on the other hand, span across generations of young and
                    young-at-heart Filipinos who are actively searching for your business.
                    <div class="clearfix"></div>
                    Because Flipstop&#153; is extremely intuitive, it provides ease-of-use even to the
                    least tech-savvy of Filipinos. As younger users teach their 'elders' how to
                    use the app, it exponentially increases engagement and
                    cross-generational use of Flipstop&#153;.

                    to the Filipino consumer any time on any smartphone or web browser.
                    Remember, newspapers are not always handy, but Filipinos always
                    have their smartphones in hand. For the marketing expense,
                    your advertising message lives much longer and costs much less.
